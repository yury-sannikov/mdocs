After Dr. Tabb messed up an Onlay procedure, we went to get a second opinion. After seeing a dentist from the University of Maryland, we found out my wife never had any cavities in the first place, and didn't need any extra procedures besides a basic cleaning. She also did extra procedures on my wife that are only done on kids in rare situations. We paid a lot of money out of pocket. Dr. Tabb also didn't inform us about the extent of the procedures that needed to happen until she numbed her mouth up with lidocaine. The onlay procedure Dr. Tabb did for a tooth that was healthy is now a major problem for my wife and she has constant tooth pain even after trying to get it fixed with another dentist. An onlay is an outdated procedure that no one does any more. Dr. Tabb's office did refund some of our money only after filing a complaint with the Maryland Dental Board but my wife may have to live with the pain in her tooth unless she gets a more extensive procedure. Dr. Tabb seemed nice in person but  we were deceived by her initial demeanor. Dr. Tabb is getting away with unethical practices and malpractice.  As a physician, I would be terrified if anyone gets dental work done from her in the future.",

She has \"good hands\", sure judgement, a highly cooperative staff and a laser focus when performing oral procedures.  She provides clear advice about the benefits of doing and risks of not doing any treatments she recommends.  She has shown clear attention as to which procedures I would prefer to have her perform, and in what time frame. Some of what is on offer are entirely optional. As to those I have chosen to decline (Invisalign to straighten my teeth, night guard), I've been met with no resistance, only slight persistence on her part. She wholeheartedly serves in her vocation, which is apparently to remove sick tissue (cavities or teeth), while avoiding inflicting any pain. She's so good at it! Each person needs to draw the line at some level of service, but not everyone aspires to perfection. It is appropriate for any dentist to offer a full range of services, so long as those are apparently appropriate for an individual. She does everything very well. ",

            "text": "Here's the deal about Dr. Cuevas.  Six (6) years ago I came to DC and she became my dentist.  The first thing she did was to take a full set of x-rays and a head scan to get a complete picture of all of the \"stuff\" happening in my mouth.  We discussed the results and then we entered into a long term partnership to correct/fix/improve each piece of \"stuff\" one step at a time.  First the silver fillings were replaced with white porcelain once, than the cavities were filled, than came the root canal, and lastly, the tooth replacement.  Dr. Cuevas worked with me to ensure the timing of each action wouldn't place a financial burden on me (great...right??). So today I have a healthy, attractive month, which has increased my confidence.  All of this happened because six years ago Dr. Cuevas said Hello ... I'm here to help you. ",
