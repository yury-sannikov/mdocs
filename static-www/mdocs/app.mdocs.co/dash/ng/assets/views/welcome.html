                        <p>This version uses the exact same CSS files the HTML/PHP versions are using, so any markup from the example pages of those versions can be used in this one. All ready pages which are not presented here will look great, so no worries!</p>

Also, Grunt’s build task was enchanced for this version and will now build your whole app and prepare it for production environments.</p>
