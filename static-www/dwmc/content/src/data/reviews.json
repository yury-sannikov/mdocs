It’s the same story shared by countless others with poor vision.  And like so many others, I have thought about Dental Procedure eye surgery for a long time, wondering if the technology had advanced enough for me to be comfortable and if it was worth the cost. And then I decided to do it. I became convinced Dental Procedure eye surgery was the right choice while at a friend’s house for a party recently. The kitchen was packed shoulder-to-shoulder, and the radiator heat was blasting on the cool evening. Almost immediately, my eyes were irritated. My contacts felt dry and scratchy and my vision was hazy like someone had turned on a smoke machine.  No more, I thought. It’s time for Dental Procedure.",
