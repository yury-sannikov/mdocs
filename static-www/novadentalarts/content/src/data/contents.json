I have been a practicing dentist for over 17 years, having graduated from the University of Louisville School of Dentistry. My family has strong roots in Northern Virginia; my great grandfather moved here in 1895. I love this area, its people and all the cultures represented from all over the world.</p><p>“I am happy and honored to have a terrific staff, the best people any dental practice could have: Susie, Karen, Joellen, Darota, Pat, Terri, Kim, Kymber and Nina. They are true professionals, extremely knowledgeable and skilled, and they will take great care of you.</p><p>“My purpose is to improve your quality of life, by helping you keep your teeth healthy, strong and beautiful for your entire life. My staff and I pride ourselves on gentle dental care. I also like to take time with each person to determine their needs and wants. Each year I take numerous continuing education courses in advanced clinical procedures and dental technology, as well as Invisalign. I have also lectured on dental procedures to other dentists over the past few years.</p><p>“We provide all general dental procedures: fillings, fixing broken teeth, treating toothaches, crowns and dentures, extractions, root canals and implants. If you want a more beautiful smile, we provide all cosmetic procedures. If you are unhappy with any aspect of your smile, I will be happy to discuss the best options for you. Together, we can determine what will work for you.</p><p>“If you have any dental emergencies, we will see you the same day. We have a very nice office just a few minutes from you. Our office is modern with the latest advancements in dental technologies and materials. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us today on 703-444-5108.</p><p>“I look forward to meeting you.</p><p>Warmly Yours,<br>Dr. Nader Hawa”</p><div id='magazine-wrapper'><img src='/assets/images/nova-why-choose-us.jpg' alt='Why choose us' class='mb why-choose-us'><div id='magazine'><h3>Our Magazine</h3><p>For insight into Dr. Hawa and Northern Virginia Dental Arts, <a href='/pdfs/hawa-mag-gilleard-web.pdf' target='_blank'>download</a> our magazine today.</p><img src='/assets/images/magazine-arrow-on-white.jpg' alt='Magazine' id='magazine-arrow'></div></div><p class='header margin'>Why choose Northern Virginia Dental Arts?</p><p><strong>1.
