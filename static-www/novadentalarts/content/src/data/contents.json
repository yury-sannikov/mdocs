I have been a practicing dentist for over 17 years, having graduated from the University of Louisville School of Dentistry.

They are true professionals, extremely knowledgeable and skilled, and they will take great care of you.</p><p>“My purpose is to improve your quality of life, by helping you keep your teeth healthy, strong and beautiful for your entire life. My staff and I pride ourselves on gentle dental care. I also like to take time with each person to determine their needs and wants. Each year I take numerous continuing education courses in advanced clinical procedures and dental technology, as well as Invisalign. I have also lectured on dental procedures to other dentists over the past few years.</p><p>“We provide all general dental procedures: fillings, fixing broken teeth, treating toothaches, crowns and dentures, extractions, root canals and implants. If you want a more beautiful smile, we provide all cosmetic procedures. If you are unhappy with any aspect of your smile, I will be happy to discuss the best options for you. Together, we can determine what will work for you.</p><p>“If you have any dental emergencies, we will see you the same day. We have a very nice office just a few minutes from you. Our office is modern with the latest advancements in dental technologies and materials. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us today on 703-291-8051.</p><p>“I look forward to meeting you.</p><p>Warmly Yours,<br>Dr. Nader Hawa”</p><div id='magazine-wrapper'><img src='/assets/images/nova-why-choose-us.jpg' alt='Why choose us' class='mb why-choose-us'><div id='magazine'><h3>Our Magazine</h3><p>For insight into Dr. Hawa and Northern Virginia Dental Arts, <a href='/pdfs/hawa-mag-gilleard-web.pdf' target='_blank'>download</a> our magazine today.</p><img src='/assets/images/magazine-arrow-on-white.jpg' alt='Magazine' id='magazine-arrow'></div></div><p class='header margin'>Why choose Northern Virginia Dental Arts?</p><p><strong>1.

You will visit our Sterling, Virginia office every month or two to check your progression and get new aligners. Average treatment time is about a year. Because the aligners are removable, you can continue to eat your favorite foods. And you can brush and floss normally to keep your teeth and gums healthy.</p><img src='/assets/images/nova-invisalign-results-you-can-see.jpg' alt='Results you can see' class='mb'><p class='header margin'>Invisalign can:</p><ul class='coloured-dots purple'><li><span>Straighten your teeth invisibly</span></li><li><span>Straighten your teeth without fear of carrying your meal in your braces</span></li><li><span>Allow you to you eat the foods you like during the adjustment</span></li><li><span>Make cleaning and brushing easy</span></li><li><span>Correct an over-bite or under-bite</span></li><li><span>Correct a distracting gap</span></li><li><span>Correct overlap/crowding issues</span></li></ul><p class='header'>How does it work?</p><p>Invisalign<sup>®</sup> clear aligners take a modern approach to straightening teeth, using a custom-made series of aligners created for you and only you. These aligners are made of smooth, comfortable and virtually invisible plastic that you simply wear over your teeth. Wearing the aligners will gradually and gently shift your teeth into place, based on the exact movements your dentist or orthodontist plans out for you. </p><div class='photos-adjacent margin-bottom'><img alt='Invisalign Adult' src='/assets/images/nova-invisalign-adult.jpg'><img alt='Invisalign Retainer' src='/assets/images/invisalign-retainer.jpg'></div><p>There are no metal brackets to attach and no wires to tighten. You simply pop in a new set of aligners approximately every two weeks, until your treatment is complete and you achieve the confident smile that you’ve always wanted. The best part about the whole process is that most people won’t even know you’re straightening your teeth.</p><p>Get the beautiful smile you’ve always wanted, without braces! With Invisalign, there’s no reason to step back from your professional or social life and every reason to lean in. The nearly invisible aligners allow you to go about your life with confidence and give you a clear path to a beautiful smile.</p><p><strong>Ask Dr. Hawa today how Invisalign clear aligners can work for you.</strong></p>"

Your mouth is an entry point for the rest of your body, and this is why oral health is so important. Regular dental visits, cleanings and screenings help maintain a healthy mouth and improve your defense system against harmful disease.</p><p>If oral attackers, like germs and bacteria, get beyond your natural defenses, the result is periodontal (gum) disease.

Mucus, food residue, and bacteria form the sticky, colorless plaque you hear about in toothpaste commercials. Plaque hardens over time into tarter. Brushing and flossing are effective in fighting plaque, but they will remove tarter. Only a trip to the dental hygientist will get ride of unsightly and unhealthy tarter.</p><p>Bacteria build up like plaque and tarter cause inflammation of the gums called gingivitis. If left untreated, the gingivitis will turn into periodontitis – an extremely harmful condition to your dental health and the health of your overall body. When bacteria enters your blood stream, it has access to your entire body and can cause inflammation, infection, and disease in internal organs.</p><p>You may not be aware of your gum disease because it progresses silently and often painlessly. At the age of 35, three of every four people have gum disease.</p><p>We can stop or control gum disease if we catch it early enough. Dr. Robert Holt, a periodontist with the Florida Institute for Periodontics &amp; Dental Implants, states: “In the past, periodontal disease was just considered a mouth infection. But it's not just a mouth infection anymore. Researchers have discovered correlations between periodontal disease and chronic medical conditions. Now, more than ever, people have solid reasons for taking care of their teeth and gums.”</p><div class='health-pdf'><a href='/assets/files/American-Academy-Oral-Systemic-Health.pdf' target='_blank'><img src='/assets/images/pdf-icon.png' alt='Download PDF'></a><div><p class='purple'><a href='/assets/files/American-Academy-Oral-Systemic-Health.pdf' target='_blank'>Download this free guide from the American Academy of Oral Systemic Health »</a></p></div></div><p class='header'>Preventing Oral Disease</p><p>A routine dental examination performed every six months at Northern Virginia Dental will help you catch any problems and prevent potential health problems.
