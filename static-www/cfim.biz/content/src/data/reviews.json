    "reviewShort": "The office was clean and all of the staff I encountered were friendly and knowledgeable.",
    "reviewLong": "The doctor spoke frankly about the prognosis and risks of sclerotherapy, and the procedure was performed by a nurse (Kim) who was very friendly, helpful and thorough. Pain wise, I would say it is comparable to laser vein removal since you are injected in the spider veins multiple times with a very small needle - just felt like quick little pricks or being snapped with a rubber band, but very tolerable in my opinion."

    "reviewLong": "Dr Antani was very down to earth. Even though I had sclerotherapy in the past I knew very little about the procedure.  He wasn't rushed or pushy which is usually the case with a deal this good.  Didn't pressure me to buy the compression stockings they have there or to buy more sessions. So refreshing."

    "reviewLong": "I bought a deal on Amazon deals (sclerotherapy for spider veins in my leg) and just thought I'd give it a whirl. The doctor spoke VERY plainly to me and I felt like he was really listening. It was a very relaxed environment but not the point of unprofessionalism. I was extremely comfortable and know I'll be going back there even though I live 45 minutes away."
