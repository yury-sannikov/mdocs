    "htmlContent": "<h2>All-Laser LASIK is the standard for accuracy and safety</h2><p>Your eyes and vision are so important to you, that, although you’ve considered laser vision correction, you’ve been afraid to take a chance. <h2>Intralase Femtosecond Laser</h2>Does this sound familiar? We hear this type of concern every day. That’s why Dr. Tanchel has continued to use the best and safest technology to treat her patients, and why she was very pleased to be the first in 2003 to acquire the Intralase femtosecond laser. She’s now first again with the next generation of femtosecond laser – the Ziemer Femto LDV, performing Z-LASIK.</p><p>She is the most experienced <a title='Washington DC LASIK cost | DC area LASIK | DC area LASIK eye surgery' href='http://www.libertylasereye.com/lasik-procedures/'>LASIK</a> surgeon in the Washington, DC metro region to utilize the femtosecond laser in her center.</p><h2>True Scientific Breakthrough</h2><p>All-Laser LASIK is a true advance in vision correction surgery. The femtosecond laser eliminates the most serious risks associated with the LASIK procedure. It is an advance in accuracy and safety which should eliminate the fear many of us have when considering a procedure to eliminate the dependence on glasses and contact lenses.</p><p>Dr. Tanchel has been using the most advanced femtosecond lasers for over 10 years, and has the experience to get the most from the technology with unsurpassed results for our patients.</p>"

    "description": "P-LASIK works by restoring negative spherical aberration to the eyes. This wavefront pattern is natural in younger eyes and changes as we age. The increased negative SA provides a greater depth of field.",
    "htmlContent": "<h2>Improve Near Vision</h2><p>After hearing about Presby-LASIK or P-LASIK, which has been performed in Europe for many years, Dr. Tanchel was intrigued. P-LASIK was said to improve near vision for people over 40ish, who are having trouble seeing up close, having to move things farther and farther away to see them clearly.</p><h2>First and Only Surgeon in Northern Virginia</h2><p>Dr. Tanchel waited for some colleagues to perform a few hundred cases on the west coast, and followed their results closely. Once she was convinced that the procedure was safe and effective, she started performing P-LASIK here at Liberty Laser Eye Center in the northern Virginia / DC Metro area.  Dr. Tanchel is the first and currently the only surgeon performing P-LASIK in this region.</p><h2>Superb Results</h2><p>The results have been very gratifying, with patients over 60 years old able to see clearly at distance, as well as read a newspaper – all without the help of glasses!</p><h2>How It Works</h2><p>P-LASIK seems to work by restoring negative spherical aberration to the eyes. This wavefront pattern is natural in younger eyes and changes as we age. The increased negative SA seems to provide a greater depth of field. P-LASIK is not monovision, since both eyes see the same. It has worked very well and Dr. Tanchel is preparing to publish her results, along with a small group of surgeons from other parts of the country, treating patients with Presby-LASIK.</p><h2>Questions?</h2><p>Wondering if you’re a good candidate for LASIK eye surgery?

    "description": "PRK provides similar results as LASIK, but without creating a flap. PRK was approved for patients in the USA about 15 years ago, prior to approval of LASIK a few years later. For PRK, all of the treatment occurs on the surface of the eye, rather than under a flap as for LASIK. The healing process is much slower than LASIK, with good vision restored in about a week, rather than a few hours. Dr. Tanchel has performed thousands of PRK procedures and we can provide more information during the consultation if needed.",

It is a major innovation that provides Dr. Tanchel with more precise, comprehensive data on the patients visual performance.

By utilizing this data, vision can be optimized to be generally sharper, as well as clearer in dim light.",

This treatment is called CATz (Custom Ashperic Treatment Zone), and utilizes maps of the cornea to provide the most advanced treatment possible.  FDA studies show that this type of treatment will improve night vision for many people after treatment; in the study, no one developed night vision problems, and many people had better night vision than their best vision pre-procedure!  This is a major advance in precision and leads to real happiness and great results.</p><h2>Accuracy</h2><p>Older “custom” LASIK, based on wavefront measurements is less accurate than the newer topography guided treatment.</p><h2>Call Us</h2><p>We are proud to provide this most advanced treatment for our patients at Liberty Laser Eye Center.  Give us a call to set up your complimentary consultation to learn more, or schedule your consultation online.  We hope to meet you soon, in person.</p>"
