        <h4>What is LASIK?</h4>
        <p>For years the eye doctors at Liberty Laser Eye have been performing LASIK to correct vision. LASIK is a laser procedure in which a laser sculpts the cornea of the eye to correct the abnormalities that cause nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. We now provide the most advanced procedures available with wavefront optimized treatment, as well as topography guided procedures. Nowhere else in the region can you benefit from these most advanced techniques.</p>

        <h4>What is All-Laser LASIK?</h4>
        <p>Originally LASIK procedures were performed by using a hand-held mechanical razor blade; some centers still use this. Due to complications from the original LASIK procedure, all-laser technology was developed for added precision. Liberty Laser uses Z-LASIK, the most technologically advanced form of all-laser LASIK.</p>

        <h4>Does LASIK hurt?</h4>
        <p>While the device used to keep your eyelids open during the procedure may be somewhat uncomfortable, there is no pain involved in the procedure. Anesthetic eye drops are used to ensure that you will have no pain during the surgery itself. Some patients have reported dry eyes for a short period after the procedure, but generally the recovery period is pain-free.</p>

        <h4>How will I see after the procedure?</h4>
        <p>Your vision after the LASIK procedure will be better than it was when you wore glasses. For a short period following the procedure, your vision will be good but may seem somewhat hazy.</p>
